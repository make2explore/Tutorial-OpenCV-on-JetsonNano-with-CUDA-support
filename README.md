**OpenCV** (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source software library used for **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **image processing**. It provides a wide range of tools and functionalities that allow developers to process, analyze, and manipulate images and videos, making it a popular choice for tasks like object detection, image recognition, and facial recognition. 
  
The **NVIDIA Jetson Nano** is a small, powerful computing platform designed for edge AI applications, such as robotics, IoT devices, and computer vision projects. Despite its compact size, it includes a GPU based on NVIDIA's Maxwell architecture, which supports CUDA, making it capable of performing GPU-accelerated computing tasks.  
  
A **CUDA accelerator** refers to the use of NVIDIA GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) as specialized hardware accelerators to perform computational tasks faster than a traditional CPU (Central Processing Unit). The term "accelerator" in this context highlights the GPU's role in speeding up specific types of computations, particularly those that can be parallelized.  
  
*Why would you install OpenCV on the Jetson Nano, when your operating system has already a version pre-installed?* 
==> The main reason is that the **shipped version has no CUDA support**. And after all, wasn't the CUDA accelerator the main reason why we bought the Jetson Nano in the first place.
